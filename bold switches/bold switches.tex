% Chapter 3, Marilla Cuthbert Is Surprised
``No. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A \bfseries girl \mdseries would be of no use to us. Take off your hat. I'll lay it and your bag on the hall table.''

Anne took off her hat meekly. Matthew came back presently and they sat down to supper. \bfseries But Anne could not eat.\mdseries In vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her plate. She did not really make any headway at all.

``You're not eating anything,'' said Marilla sharply, eying her as if it were a serious shortcoming. Anne sighed.

\bfseries``I can't. I'm in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair?''\mdseries

``I've never been in the depths of despair, so I can't say,'' responded Marilla.

\bfseries``Weren't you? Well, did you ever try to imagine you were in the depths of despair?''

``No, I didn't.''\mdseries

``Then I don't think you can understand what it's like. It's a very uncomfortable feeling indeed. When you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you can't swallow anything, not even if it was a chocolate caramel. I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious. I've often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I'm going to eat them. I do hope you won't be offended because I can't eat. Everything is extremely nice, but still I cannot eat.''
