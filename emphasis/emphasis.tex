\section{Regular Text}
\textit{Huzzah, this amazing sentence is entirely in italics!} In contrast, a \textit{small piece} of this obligatory statement is \textit{italicized}. Finally, this dull sentence is unremarkable as no word is italicized.

This paragraph is regular text as it clearly not italicized. The next paragraph is from \underline{Anne of Green Gables} and showcases italics.

"Pretty? Oh, \textit{pretty} doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful, either. They don't go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful---wonderful. It's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by imagination. It just satisfied me here"---she put one hand on her breast---"it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did you ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?"

\textbf{"Well now, I just can't recollect that I ever had."}

The previous paragraph is \textbf{bold}.
